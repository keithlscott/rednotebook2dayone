# rednotebook2dayone

A python script to convert from rednotebook format to DayOne (classic) format.

I converted from rednotebook to DayOne classic, then imported the DayOne classic entries to DayOne version 2.

# Caveats
* Probably doesn't handle all possible special characters (like '&', '<', and '>', which it does handle)
* Can be confused by instances of '}' in entry text
* Input and output directories are hard-coded
